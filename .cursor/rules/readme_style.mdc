# README Engineering Standard Style Guide

Apply this rule when creating or editing files named `README.md`. Enforce the following structure and tone for all generated READMEs.

---

## 1. Header Structure

### Title (H1)
- Use a single H1 with a **relevant emoji** that reflects the project (e.g., `# 📦 Project Name`, `# 🤖 API Client`).

### Badges
- Place **Shields.io** badges immediately under the title.
- Include at least:
  - **Python** (version or “Python 3” badge).
  - **License** (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
  - **Status** (e.g., “maintained”, “active”, “beta”).
- Use markdown image syntax: `![Alt](https://img.shields.io/...)`.

### Table of Contents
- **Mandatory** when the file is longer than 50 lines.
- Use anchor links to H2 (and optionally H3) sections.
- Keep ToC concise; list main sections only when the file is short.

---

## 2. Section Formatting (H2)

Use **H2** for major sections. Assign the following **emojis** to these section types for consistent visual scanning:

| Section purpose        | H2 format / emoji |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Project description   | `## 🧐 About`     |
| System design          | `## 🏗️ Architecture` |
| Dependencies / tools   | `## 🛠️ Tech Stack`   |
| Installation / setup   | `## 🚀 Getting Started` |
| Usage / demo / results | `## 📉 Results/Demo` or `## 📉 Usage` |

- Use these exact emoji + label pairs when the section matches the purpose above.
- Add other H2s as needed; use a single, relevant emoji for consistency.

---

## 3. Visuals & Diagrams

### Architecture
- Under **🏗️ Architecture**, **always suggest or include** a **Mermaid.js flowchart** (or sequence diagram) that illustrates the system or data flow.
- Use fenced code blocks with the `mermaid` language:
  ```markdown
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    A[Component] --> B[Service]
  ```
  ```

### Project layout
- Include a **directory tree** of the project (or main folders) using a **`.` tree structure** (plain text, monospace).
- Example:
  ```text
  .
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.py
  │   └── utils/
  ├── tests/
  └── README.md
  ```
- Keep the tree concise; omit irrelevant or generated folders (e.g., `__pycache__`, `node_modules`) unless they matter for the reader.

---

## 4. Code Blocks

- **Always specify the language** for fenced code blocks (e.g., ` ```python `, ` ```bash `, ` ```json `).
- **Include short comments** in code snippets that explain the **“why”** or non-obvious steps, not only the “what”.
- Prefer small, runnable examples over long scripts.

---

## 5. Tone & Voice

- **Precise**: Use correct technical terms; avoid vague wording.
- **Technical**: Assume a developer reader; link to docs or specs when helpful.
- **Concise**: Prefer short sentences and bullet lists; avoid long paragraphs.
- **Active voice**: Write “Run the script” not “The script can be run”; “Install dependencies” not “Dependencies should be installed”.

---

## Checklist (when generating a README)

- [ ] H1 title includes a relevant emoji.
- [ ] Shields.io badges (Python, License, Status) appear under the title.
- [ ] ToC present if file length &gt; 50 lines.
